# Real-Time-Bus-Tracking
In this excercise data and functionality are extracted from Mapbox and used to visually show the location of a bus move between the Bay Ridge Brooklyn and NYU. This activity generated from MIT usage of the MBTA bus data to determine stops between Harvard and MIT. Then, you need to and add an animated marker on the map to highlight the bus routes.
# How to Run This Program
You can click the button at the top of the page to see the marker of the object movement. The start point is Bay Ridge Brooklyn and the final destination is NYU. Each click move the marker one stop closer to the 'final' stop.
# Future RoadMap
Additional map animation using Mapbox ecosystem will be added to this route to include stops between United Nations Plaza and Columbia University.
